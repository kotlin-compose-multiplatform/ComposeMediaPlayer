/**
 * Defines a platform-specific video player state interface, providing the essential
 * properties and operations needed for video playback management.
 *
 * The interface is intended to be implemented by platform-specific classes, acting as
 * a layer to abstract the underlying behavior of video players across different operating systems.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - `isPlaying`: Read-only property indicating whether the video is currently playing.
 * - `volume`: Controls the playback volume, with values between 0.0 (mute) and 1.0 (full volume).
 * - `sliderPos`: Represents the current playback position as a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.
 * - `userDragging`: Tracks if the user is currently interacting with the playback position control.
 * - `loop`: Specifies whether the video playback should loop continuously.
 * - `leftLevel`: Read-only property giving the audio peak level of the left channel.
 * - `rightLevel`: Read-only property giving the audio peak level of the right channel.
 * - `positionText`: Provides a formatted text representation of the current playback position.
 * - `durationText`: Provides a formatted text representation of the total duration of the video.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - `openUri(uri: String)`: Opens a video resource (file or URL) for playback.
 * - `play()`: Begins or resumes video playback.
 * - `pause()`: Pauses the current video playback.
 * - `stop()`: Stops playback and resets the playback position to the beginning.
 * - `seekTo(value: Float)`: Seeks to a specific playback position based on the given normalized value.
 * - `dispose()`: Releases resources and performs cleanup for the video player instance.
